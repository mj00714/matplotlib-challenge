A repository for python plotting exercises

Notes: 

For the summary statistics, the mean, median variance, standard dev and statard error were calculated using the pd.pivot_table function. Our instructor stated that this was acceptable if it acheived the desired results since 'groupby' was being utilized in other sections of the challenge. This shortened the code because the output was produced into a dataframe. 

For the box plots, pivot tables were again used to group the data and create new indexes for the same reasons listed, above. 

If either of these methodologies are not accepted, please let me know and I will reproduce the dataframes. The starter file was left in the folder for my own future reference.
